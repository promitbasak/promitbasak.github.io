Hi, I'm Promit Basak - a PhD student, researcher and engineer passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI, human-computer interaction and healthcare. I am currently doing my PhD in Computer Science at the [University of Texas at Arlington](https://www.uta.edu). Before that, I completed my Bachelor's from the [University of Dhaka](https://du.ac.bd/) and have been deeply involved in research during my time as a Research Assistant at [Qatar University](https://www.qu.edu.qa/en-us/), and as a Machine Learning Engineer at [mPower Social](https://mpower-social.com/) focusing on cutting-edge deep learning applications.

<!-- I thrive on solving complex problems, whether it’s using AI to improve healthcare diagnostics or building systems that make human-computer interactions more natural. My interests also extend to AI fairness, where I’m working to ensure machine learning models are inclusive and equitable for everyone. -->
