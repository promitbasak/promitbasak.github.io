**CGPA**: **3.63** out of 4.00 <br>
**Major**: Computer <br>
**Minor**: Communication <br>


**Thesis Projects**:
  - Developed a **Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) model** for human activity recognition, demonstrating new ways to monitor activity through wireless signals.
  - Designed a framework for **fetal ECG extraction** from maternal ECG, which received high praise and led to a publication in a **Q1 journal**.

<!-- ### **Online Coursework in Computer Science**

To further prepare for graduate studies in Computer Science, I completed several advanced MOOCs to strengthen my programming and theoretical background:

- **[Object-Oriented Data Structures in C++](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-fundamentals-1)** – Dr. Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
- **[Beginning C++ Programming - From Beginner to Beyond](https://www.udemy.com/course/beginning-c-plus-plus-programming/)** – Dr. Frank Mitropoulos, Udemy
- **[Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)** – Dr. Wayne and Dr. Sedgewick, Princeton University
- **[Mathematics For Computer Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2005/)** – Dr. Leighton and van Dijk, MIT OpenCourseWare

This additional coursework helped me bridge the gap between my electrical engineering background and advanced computer science, equipping me with strong fundamentals for deep learning, data structures, and algorithmic thinking. -->
