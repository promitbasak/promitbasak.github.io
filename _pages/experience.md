Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work as a Research Assistant at Qatar University, where I contribute to cutting-edge projects in **deep learning** and **biomedical AI**. My work focuses on developing novel deep learning models for **medical image analysis** and signal processing, particularly for non-invasive diagnostic solutions. During my time here, I have:

- Developed a machine-agnostic framework for the **segmentation of lumbar MR images**, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.
- Designed and implemented a deep learning model to extract fetal ECG from non-invasive abdominal ECG signals, advancing early diagnosis of fetal health conditions.
- Contributed to publications in high-impact journals, demonstrating novel approaches to **biomedical AI** problems.
