### Overview

The **Cattle Identifier using Muzzle Imprint** project aims to provide a robust identification system for cattle using images captured by smartphone cameras. By leveraging the uniqueness of each cowâ€™s muzzle pattern, this system enables a non-invasive approach to cattle identification, especially useful for large-scale livestock management in rural and farm settings.

### Key Objectives

- **Muzzle Detection**: Utilizes object detection techniques to accurately isolate the muzzle area in cattle images.
- **Image Enhancement**: Applies computer vision techniques to enhance the muzzle region, improving the precision of identification.
- **Unique Classification**: Processes each enhanced muzzle image to uniquely identify individual cattle, offering a viable alternative to physical tagging.

### Impact

This system presents a scalable solution for livestock monitoring, aiding farmers in efficient and humane cattle management. It reduces dependency on invasive tagging methods while ensuring each animal is tracked accurately.
