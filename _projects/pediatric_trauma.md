### Overview

The **Pediatric Trauma Recognition** project is designed to detect various types of trauma in pediatric X-ray images. By automating the detection of fractures, periosteal reactions, and other indicators of trauma, this system assists radiologists, especially in fast-paced clinical settings.

### Achievements

- **High-Accuracy Detection**: Surpasses existing models in detecting trauma types, making it a powerful tool for pediatric radiology.
- **Enhanced Image Processing**: Applies advanced image processing techniques to increase sensitivity to subtle trauma signs, supporting early and accurate diagnosis.

### Clinical Impact

This system offers an essential tool for pediatric healthcare providers, aiding in faster and more reliable trauma detection. It reduces diagnostic time, supports early intervention, and ultimately improves patient outcomes.
