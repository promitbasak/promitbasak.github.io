### Overview

The **Anatomical Segmentation of Lumbar MR Images** project creates a machine-agnostic framework for segmenting lumbar vertebrae and intervertebral discs from MRI scans. By segmenting each vertebra and disc accurately, this tool aids in spinal diagnostics and supports research on spinal health.

### Key Features

- **Generalized Framework**: Works across different MRI machines, making it a versatile tool for various clinical and research settings.
- **State-of-the-Art Accuracy**: Outperforms most known approaches in segmentation accuracy, leading to more reliable diagnosis and treatment planning.

### Applications

This segmentation tool enhances radiology workflows, allowing healthcare professionals to assess spinal health with greater precision. It also provides valuable anatomical data for researchers studying spinal disorders.
