### Overview

This **Human Activity Recognition using Wi-Fi CSI** project classifies human activities by analyzing Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI), eliminating the need for imaging devices. Designed for semi-controlled environments, it leverages Wi-Fi signals to interpret activities like walking, sitting, and standing.

### Additional Contributions

- **Custom Dataset**: Created a dataset with over **15 subjects and 800+ samples** using microcontroller devices, contributing valuable data to the research community.
- **Non-Intrusive Approach**: Provides privacy-preserving activity recognition, beneficial for smart home environments and healthcare monitoring.

### Practical Applications

The system supports non-intrusive activity recognition in semi-controlled environments, applicable in home automation, healthcare, and elderly care.
