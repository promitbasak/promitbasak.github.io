### Overview

The **Adventitious Lung Sound Estimation** system is designed to detect and analyze pediatric lung sounds for early diagnosis of respiratory conditions. Using audio recordings from electronic stethoscopes, it differentiates between normal and abnormal lung sounds, enabling timely intervention.

### Key Features

- **Lung Sound Detection**: Identifies various types of lung sounds with high accuracy, supporting early respiratory health diagnostics.
- **Heart Rate Variability Metrics**: Measures key metrics related to heart rate variability, offering comprehensive health insights beyond respiratory health.

### Clinical Applications

This system assists in pediatric care by providing reliable lung sound assessments, crucial for detecting conditions like asthma and bronchitis early, especially in primary healthcare and rural setups.
