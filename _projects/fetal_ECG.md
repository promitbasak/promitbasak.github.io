### Overview

The **Non-invasive Fetal ECG Extraction** project focuses on reconstructing fetal ECG from maternal abdominal ECG recordings. By utilizing a GAN-based framework, it enables non-invasive fetal monitoring, supporting earlier detection of potential health issues.

### Benefits

- **Early Diagnostic Tool**: Facilitates early detection of fetal abnormalities through non-invasive monitoring, essential for prenatal care.
- **Heart Rate Variability Analysis**: Accurately measures fetal heart rate variability, providing critical insights into fetal well-being.

### Impact on Prenatal Care

This innovative system offers a safer alternative for fetal monitoring, reducing the risks associated with invasive procedures and supporting healthier pregnancies.
