### Overview

The **Transportation Mode Detection** project recognizes eight transportation modes using GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular data from smartphones. This system provides a **windowless approach** to human activity recognition, enhancing model generalization across diverse environments.

### Innovation

- **Windowless Detection**: Improves model adaptability across transportation modes without relying on fixed time windows.
- **Multi-Modal Data**: Combines wireless data types to achieve high accuracy in transportation mode classification.

### Applications

This system supports smart mobility and transportation analytics, offering valuable insights into travel patterns and user behavior.
