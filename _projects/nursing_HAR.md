### Overview

The **Nursing Care Activity Recognition** project focuses on recognizing and classifying nursing activities to assist in healthcare monitoring and improve patient care. This project utilizes **motion capture data** to analyze common nursing actions and ensure tasks are performed according to care standards, enhancing patient safety and operational efficiency.

### Key Features

- **Action Classification**: Identifies specific nursing tasks, such as medication administration, patient positioning, and vitals assessment.
- **Assisted Living Applications**: Supports assisted living environments by monitoring nursing activities, helping in quality control and training.
- **Scalable Framework**: The model is designed to be extended to other healthcare settings with minimal adjustments, making it versatile for broader applications.

### Methodology

- Collected **motion capture data** specific to nursing activities in a controlled environment.
- Applied machine learning techniques to classify activities and detect deviations, with a focus on reliability and low false positives.

### Impact

- Enhances **patient care** by monitoring nursing routines, providing insights into areas of improvement.
- Supports **training programs** for nursing staff by highlighting common errors or missed steps, thus contributing to a safer healthcare environment.
