### Overview

This **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system** is built to assess Bengali pronunciation for non-native speakers. Through a novel **Phonetic Distance** metric, it provides accurate pronunciation scoring, assisting learners in overcoming linguistic barriers and improving their language skills.

### Highlights

- **Unique Scoring Metric**: Introduces Phonetic Distance, which accurately scores pronunciation by addressing character-phone variability and Unicode issues common in Indic languages.
- **High-Performance Transformers**: Uses advanced transformer models for precise speech recognition, suitable for interactive language learning applications.

### Educational Impact

This ASR tool supports language learning for non-native Bengali speakers by providing clear, actionable feedback on pronunciation, aiding both independent learners and structured language programs.
